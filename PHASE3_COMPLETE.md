## 🎯 Phase 3 Features

### 1. Smart Suggestions 💡

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your database for optimization opportunities
- Detects duplicates wasting space
- Identifies unbalanced file distributions
- Finds large files consuming storage
- Provides actionable commands

**Example output:**
```
🔴 [HIGH] Found 5 duplicate files
  • Duplicate groups: 2
  • Wasted space: 15.3 MB
  💡 Suggested action: python file_organizer.py <folder> --no-dry-run --remove-duplicates

🟡 [MEDIUM] Top 5 files occupy 250 MB
  • Largest file: video_project.mp4
  • Size: 120 MB
  💡 Suggestion: Consider archiving or compressing large files
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python file_organizer.py --suggest
```

---

### 2. Batch Undo 🔄

**What it does:**
- Undo ANY operation by its ID, not just the last one
- List all operations with dates and file counts
- Graceful error handling for missing files
- Dry-run preview before undoing

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# List all operations
python file_organizer.py --list-operations

# Output:
# 1. run_20251027_125823_2786c52a
#    Date: 2025-10-27 12:58:23
#    Files: 3
#
# 2. run_20251027_120000_abcd1234
#    Date: 2025-10-27 12:00:00
#    Files: 15

# Undo specific operation (preview)
python file_organizer.py --undo run_20251027_120000_abcd1234

# Undo for real
python file_organizer.py --undo run_20251027_120000_abcd1234 --no-dry-run
```

---

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting 📊

**What it does:**
- Export detailed insights to CSV or JSON
- Multiple report files for different data
- Console summary with visual bars
- Statistics, duplicates, large files, temporal analysis

**JSON Report includes:**
```json
{
  "report_metadata": { "generated_at": "...", "version": "3.0" },
  "summary": { "total_files": 50, "total_size_mb": 125.3 },
  "file_distribution": { "by_type": {...}, "percentages": {...} },
  "duplicates": { "total_duplicate_groups": 3, "wasted_space_mb": 15.2 },
  "large_files": { "top_10": [...] },
  "temporal_analysis": {...},
  "operations_history": {...},
  "suggestions": [...]
}
```

**CSV Export creates:**
- `report_summary.csv` - Overall statistics
- `report_distribution.csv` - Files by type
- `report_large_files.csv` - Top 10 largest files
- `report_duplicates.csv` - Duplicate groups
- `report_operations.csv` - Operations history

**Usage:**
```bash
# JSON report
python file_organizer.py --report analysis.json

# CSV reports
python file_organizer.py --report analysis.csv
```

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Suggestion Priority System
**Decision:** Use high/medium/low priority with emojis
**Why:**
- Easy to scan visually
- Helps users focus on important issues first
- Emojis make output friendly

### 2. Multiple CSV Files
**Decision:** Split CSV export into multiple files
**Why:**
- Each file has consistent column structure
- Easier to import into Excel/analysis tools
- Avoids nested data in flat CSV format

### 3. Batch Undo Requires Confirmation
**Decision:** Always ask "yes/no" before undoing
**Why:**
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Same pattern as Phase 2 undo
- Dry-run mode available for preview

### 4. Report Console + Export
**Decision:** Always print summary AND create file
**Why:**
- Users see results immediately
- File provides detailed data for analysis
- Best of both worlds

### 5. Suggestions Are Actionable
**Decision:** Every suggestion includes CLI command
**Why:**
- Users know exactly what to run
- Reduces friction to take action
- Educational for new users
